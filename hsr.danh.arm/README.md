     ```
     $ cd $FIP_HOME/gig_eth_mac/fifo_async/z7/vivado.2018.3

### 4.2 HW simulation
This step run simulation in order to verify functionality,
where a few number of HSR nodes are connected to build HSR ring
and each HSR node consists of tester and the design for PL.

![Simulation](./doc/images/hsr_danh-simulation.png "Simulation")

<details>

#### 4.2.1 Xilinx Vivado Simulator

  1. go to 'hw/sim/xsim'
  2. 'BOARD_ZED' macro should be defined in 'sim_define.v' file.
  3. run 'make'<br />
     ```
     $ make
     ```
     For more details, have a look at 'Makefile'.
  4. check simulation result by viewing 'wave.vcd'<br>
     This step requires VCD viewer, for example GTKwave.
     ```
     $ gtkwave wave.vcd
     ```

Following simulation wave demonstrates a scenario that NODE 0 sends a packet to NODE 1.

  1. NODE 0 duplicates the packet and sends NODE 1 and NODE 2
  2. NODE 1 receives a packet from NODE 0
     1. forwards it to the processor since it matches its MAC
     2. does not forward to NODE 2
  3. NODE 2 receives a packet form NODE 0
     1. forwards it to the NODE 1 since it does not matches its MAC
     2. does not forward it to the processor
  4. NODE 1 receives a packet from NODE 2
     1. removes it since it has been received already (It is called Quick Remove.)

![Simulation Wave](./doc/images/hsr_danh-simulation-wave.png "Simulation Wave")

You can add or modify testing scenario by updating 'tester.v' in 'hw/beh/verilog' directory.

#### 4.2.2 Mentor Graphics ModelSim or QuestaSim

  1. go to 'hw/sim/modelsim.vivado
  2. 'BOARD_ZED' macro should be defined in 'sim_define.v' file.
  3. run 'make'<br />
     ```
     $ make
     ```
     For more details, have a look at 'Makefile'.
  4. check simulation result by viewing 'wave.vcd'<br>

     ```
     $ gtkwave wave.vcd
     ```

     * "zed_bd_wrapper.bit"
     * "zed_bd_wrapper_sysdef.hdf" (It can be check by "$ unzip -l zed_bd_wrapper.hdf".) (It also contains 'zed_bd_wrapper.bit'.)

# 5. SW preparation
This step compiles user application.

<details>

This step requires Xilinx software development packages, which is Xilinx SDK.

If Xilinx SDK is installed on */opt/Xilinx/SDK/2018.3*,
then source following script.

    $ source /opt/Xilinx/SDK/2018.3/settings64.sh

It can be checked as follows.

    $ which xsdk
      /opt/Xilinx/SDK/2018.3/bin/xsdk

This example uses a program that can send and receive packets.

### 5.1 Compilation

   ```
   $ cd sw.arm/eth_send_receive
   $ make
   ```

      * mac_init
      * hsr_init
   * system checking
      * mac_csr
      * hsr_csr
   * MAC address
      * mac_addr
   * packet handling
      * pkt_snd
      * pkt_rcv

</details>

# 6. <a id="testing">Testing</a>
This step programs FPGA and runs program.

<details>

This step requires a text terminal emulator (e.g., Hyperterminal, Teraterm, minicom, GTKterm)
to interacts with the program and it uses USB-to-Serial port.
The USB-to-Serial port uses 115200-baud, 8-bit, no-parity, 1-stop bit.
When HW bitstream and SW image are downloaded as described in this following section,
a monitor program runs.

First of all, connect USB-to-Serial and USB-to-JTAG, and then
download HW bitstream and SW binary to the board through USB-to-JTAG
as described in section 5.2 Download through JTAG port.

### 6.1 FPGA configuration
You can use one of two ways to configure FPGA.

#### 6.1.1 SD Card preparation (optional)
HW bitstream and SW binary can be downloaded to the board through JTAG port, and
this method needs to do again each time turning on the board.
HW bitstream and SW binary can be stored in SD Card, and
this method makes the board start automatically when turned on.

  1. Prepare FSBL (First Stage Boot Loader)
     $ cd sw.arm/fsbl
     $ make
  2. Prepare SD Card image
     $ cd bootgen
     $ make
  3. Copy 'BOOT.bin' to the SD Card (It should be FAT32 file system.)
     * Insert this SD Card into the ZedBoard
     * Make sure setting of jumper: JP-7/8/9/10/11 = G/G/V/V/G

#### 6.1.2 Download through JTAG port
HW bitstream and SW binary can be downloaded to the board through JTAG port or SD card.

   ```
   $ cd sw.arm/eth_send_receive
   $ make download
   ```

### 6.2 Single packet
Following sequence demonstrates how 'Terminal A' sends a packet to 'Terminal B',
in which 'Terminal A' and 'Terminal B' have MAC address 0x021234567801 and 0x021234567802, respectively.

|Terminal A (HSR Node 0)|Terminal B (HSR Node 1)| *Remarks* |
| --- | --- | --- |
| monitor> *mac_init*    | monitor> *mac_init*    | initialize |
| monitor> *mac_addr -r*<br>MAC 0x021234567801<br>HSR 0x021234567801 | monitor> *mac_addr -r*<br> MAC 0x021234567802<br> HSR 0x021234567802| check MAC and HSR addresses.<br>These two should be the same.<br>Actual values depends on board ID.|
| monitor> *pkt_snd -b 0x021234567802*| &nbsp; | Send a packet to the other |
| &nbsp;               | monitor> *pkt_rcv -v 3*<br>ETH mac dst: | Receive a packet |

### 6.3 Multiple packets

| Terminal A | Terminal B | Remarks |
| --- | --- | --- |
| monitor> *mac_init*   | monitor> *mac_init*   | initialize |
| monitor> *mac_addr -r*<br>MAC 0x021234567801<br>HSR 0x021234567801 | monitor> *mac_addr -r*<br> MAC 0x021234567802<br> HSR 0x021234567802| check MAC and HSR addresses.<br>These two should be the same.<br>Actual values depends on board ID.|
| &nbsp;               | monitor> *pkt_rcv -v 3 -r*| Receive packets |
| monitor> *pkt_snd -b 0x021234567802 -r*| &nbsp; | Send packets |
| &nbsp; | &nbsp; | Terminal B prints<br>packet information continuously.|
