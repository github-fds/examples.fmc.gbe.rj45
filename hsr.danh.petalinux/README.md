![Internal structure](./doc/images/hsr_danh-petalinux-block.png "Internal structure")

The blocks blue-colored are encrypted and
contact [Future Design Systems](mailto:contact@future-ds.com) if you need further information.

# 3. Design flow
This example need to follow three major steps.

   1. HW preparation<br>
      It prepares HDF (Hardware Definition File) and Bitstream file;
      the former is for SW development and the latter is for FPGA configuration.
   2. PetaLinux preparation<br>
   3. SW preparation<br>
      It prepares ELF (Executable and Linking Format) SW for PS (Processing System) of FPGA.

# 4. HW preparation
This example uses the same HW of <a href="../hsr.danh.arm/README.md" target="_blank">DANH on ARM Bare Metal with FMC-GbE-RJ45</a>.

![Block structure](./doc/images/hsr_danh-petalinux-block-vivado.png "Block structure")

# 5. PetaLinux preparation

<details>

### 5.1 Building PetaLinux
This step building PetaLinux.

   ```
   $ cd hsr.danh.petalinux/petalinx
   $ source ${HOME}/work/projects/PetaLinux/settings.sh
   $ source /opt/Xilinx/SDK/2018.3/settings64.sh
   $ make
   ```
While running make, there are two steps of '*petalinux-config*' you should set configure as follows.

[The first petalinux-config for HDF]<br>
* Yocto Settings->Enable Network state feeds: disable<br> 
* Image Packaging Configuration->Copy final images to ftpboot: disable<br>

[The second petalinux-config for ROOTFS]<br>
* Filesystem Packages->misc->gcc-runtime->{libstdc++, libstdc++-dev}: enable<br>
* Filesystem Packages->console->network->dropbear->dropbear: enable<br>
* Filesystem Packages->console->network->openssh->openssh-sftp-server: enable<br>

'*petalinux-build*' is following this ROOTFS configuration, and following two files should be ready on completion.

* zed-plnx/images/linux/BOOT.BIN: Boot loader and FPGA bit-stream
* zed-plnx/images/linux/image.ub: Linux kernel image

### 5.2 Booting from SD Card
ZedBoard can be configured using SD Card. The boot configuration DIP switches should be set properly; consult manual for details.
The USB-to-Serial port uses 115200-baud, 8-bit, no-parity, 1-stop bit.

1. Prepare ZedBoard with FMC-GbE-RJ45
  * Port 1 for HSR Link-A
  * Port 2 for HSR Link-B
  * For this DANH, Upstream link is not used (i.e., port 0)
2. Connect USB-to-Serial and invoke terminal emulator
3. Connect Ethernet
4. Go to 'petalinux' directory and copy following two files to SD Card.
  * zed-plnx/images/linux/BOOT.BIN: Boot loader and FPGA bit-stream
  * zed-plnx/images/linux/image.ub: Linux kernel image
5. Insert SD Card to the ZedBoard
  * Make sure ZedBoard is turned off
  * Make sure Booting mode selection switches are properly set as shown in Figure 5.
6. Turn on ZedBoard
  * Configuration DONE LED should be on.
  * Two LEDs should be on as shown in the picture; one for HSR ready and the other for DANH indicator.

![DANH PetaLinux on ZedBoard ](./doc/images/hsr_danh-petalinux-zed.png "DANH on ZedBoard with PetaLinux")

Push button switches:
 * HSR HW Reset: It raises reset for PL and does not affect PS.
 * CPU Reset: It raises reset for PS and makes restart PetaLinux.
 * PROGRAM: It makes FPGA program.

### 5.2 Changing MAC address
This example requires each board has unique MAC address.

* PetaLinux uses Ethernet to communicate host computer, which is used to compile and download application programs.
  * Each PetaLinux should be set a unique MAC HW address when there are more than one PetaLinux since PetaLinux uses static MAC HW address.
* MAC for HSR uses a unique MAC HW address
  * It is automatically determined by reading 8-bit Board ID switch.

In order to set user specific MAC HW address, do as follows.

* Boot PetaLinux
  * (This step may not require.) For some case following steps are also required in the PentaLinux
     ```
     PetaLinux$ rm /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules
     PetaLinux$ sync
     PetaLinux$ reboot
     ```
* While booting, stop before starting Linux. Now it is uBoot command line.
  * You need to hit any key while 'Hit any key to stop autoboot: ...'.

* Set MAC HW address something like
  * (Note that this step update flash memory. It means MAC HW address updated permanently)
  * (Make sure that the second bit of the first octet should be 1, which indicates locally managed address)
    ```
    Zynq> setenv ethaddr 02:0A:35:00:1E:50 
    Zynq> saveenv
          Saving Environment to SPI Flash...
          SF: Detected s25fl256s_64k with page size 256 Bytes, erase size 64 KiB, total 32 MiB
          Erasing SPI flash...Writing to SPI flash...done
    Zynq> reset (NOT 'boot')
    ```
* Now PetaLinux brings up
* Petalinux login will be "root" and its passwd will be "root".
  * Check MAC HW address as follows.
    ```
    PetaLinux$ ifconfig
    ```

# 7. Testing<a id="testing"></a>
This step programs FPGA and runs program.

<details>

This step requires a text terminal emulator (e.g., Hyperterminal, Teraterm, minicom, GTKterm)
to interacts with the program and it uses USB-to-Serial port.
The USB-to-Serial port uses 115200-baud, 8-bit, no-parity, 1-stop bit.
When HW bitstream and SW image are downloaded as described in Section '5.2 Download through JTAG port',
a monitor program runs.

First of all, connect USB-to-Serial and USB-to-JTAG, and then
download HW bitstream and SW binary to the board through USB-to-JTAG
as described in section 5.2 Download through JTAG port.

### 7.1 Booting PetaLinux from SD Card
<details>

HW bitstream and SW binary can be downloaded to the board through JTAG port, and
this method needs to do again each time turning on the board.
HW bitstream and SW binary can be stored in SD Card, and
this method makes the board start automatically when turned on.

  1. Copy following files to the SD Card (It should be FAT32 file system.)
     * petalinux/zed-plnx/images/linux/BOOT.bin: Bootload and FPGA bitstream
     * petalinux/zed-plnx/images/linux/image.ub: PetaLinux image

  2. Turn on ZedBoard
     * Insert this SD Card into the ZedBoard
     * Make sure setting of jumper: JP-7/8/9/10/11 = G/G/V/V/G
</details>

### 7.2 SW preparation
This step compiles user application at the host computer using PetaLinux SDK.

<details>

This step requires Xilinx PetaLinux development package.

If Xilinx PetaLinux SDK is installed on *${HONE}/work/projects/PetaLinux*,
then source following script.

    $ source ${HOME}/work/projects/PetaLinux/settings.sh

It can be checked as follows.

    $ which arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc

This example uses a program that can send and receive packets.

#### 7.2.1 Compilation

   ```
   $ cd sw.arm.petalinux/eth_send_receive
   $ make
   ```

#### 7.2.2 Program: eth_send_receive
This program provides a simple user interface through command line with following commands.

   * system initialization
      * mac_init
      * hsr_init
   * system checking
      * mac_csr
      * hsr_csr
   * MAC address
      * mac_addr
   * packet handling
      * pkt_snd
      * pkt_rcv

</details>

### 7.3 Download user application
Now download ARM executable to the ZedBoard using scp (secure copy command) through Ethernet.
<details>

The program should be download to each ZedBoard,
in which, the correct IP address (e.g., '192.168.1.235') of each ZedBoard can be checked using 'ifconfig' command.

```
$ scp eth_send_receive root@192.168.1.235:/home/root
```
Your will be asked to confirm the secure connection and then password for 'root' at the PetaLinux.
'*eth_send_receive*' program should be available at the '*/home/root*' directory of the PetaLinux.
```
PetaLinux$ pwd
/home/root
PetaLinux$ ls
eth_send_receive
```

If there is any error regarding SSH, do again after removing SSH key something like as follows.
```
$ ssh-keygen -f "${HONE}/.ssh/known_hosts" -R 192.168.1.235
```
</details>

### 7.4 Single packet
Following sequence demonstrates how 'Terminal A' sends a packet to 'Terminal B',
in which 'Terminal A' and 'Terminal B' have MAC address 0x021234567801 and 0x021234567802, respectively.

|Terminal A (HSR Node 0)|Terminal B (HSR Node 1)| *Remarks* |
| --- | --- | --- |
| monitor> *mac_init*    | monitor> *mac_init*    | initialize |
| monitor> *mac_addr -r*<br>MAC 0x021234567801<br>HSR 0x021234567801 | monitor> *mac_addr -r*<br> MAC 0x021234567802<br> HSR 0x021234567802| check MAC and HSR addresses.<br>These two should be the same.<br>Actual values depends on board ID.|
| monitor> *pkt_snd -b 0x021234567802*| &nbsp; | Send a packet to the other |
| &nbsp;               | monitor> *pkt_rcv -v 3*<br>ETH mac dst: | Receive a packet |

### 7.5 Multiple packets

| Terminal A | Terminal B | Remarks |
| --- | --- | --- |
| monitor> *mac_init*   | monitor> *mac_init*   | initialize |
| monitor> *mac_addr -r*<br>MAC 0x021234567801<br>HSR 0x021234567801 | monitor> *mac_addr -r*<br> MAC 0x021234567802<br> HSR 0x021234567802| check MAC and HSR addresses.<br>These two should be the same.<br>Actual values depends on board ID.|
| &nbsp;               | monitor> *pkt_rcv -v 3 -r*| Receive packets |
| monitor> *pkt_snd -b 0x021234567802 -r*| &nbsp; | Send packets |
| &nbsp; | &nbsp; | Terminal B prints<br>packet information continuously.|
